# traffic-sign-detection

This notebook shows how to train simple classification TensorFlow Lite model for traffic signs detection. We'll use retraining techniques on top of MobileNet v1 convolutional neural network. Like in the other project in the series - MNIST for TFLite, we'll focus more on how to plugin and utilize the model on mobile app than on training high accuracy deep learning network.
